        Let's define an Algorithm.
      </h2>

      <h4>
        In an Algorithm, <br>
        The same input will produce a unique result. <br>
        It terminates after a finite number of operations. <br>
        It must have input.<br>
        It will definitely produce one or more output results.<br>
        It does not solve only a specific problem but a certain class of problems.<br>
        It consists of sequential problem-solving steps.<br>
        Every step of the algorithm is deterministic.<br>
        It terminates after a finite number of steps.<br>

      <h2>
          Algorithms are inspired by the nature.

      <h4>
        Nature-inspired Algorithms include: <br>
        Swarm Intelligence based algorithms. <br>
        Bio-inspired intelligence based (but not SI-based) algorithms. <br>
